Beyonce (FEAT R Kelly) - If I Were A Boy
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
and I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
@If you were a boy
@Then, girl, you'd understand
@You need to stop
@listenin' to your friends
@Love, respect, and trust your man
@So I go to clubs with the guys
@And sometimes flirt with the girls
@I should be able to roll out
@as long as I'm comin' home to you
@And give you the world
@But you're not a boy
@So you don't have a clue
@How I work and pay the bills
@Girl everything I do is for you
I'd listen to her
@ahyaayeeeyayay
'Cause I know how it hurts
@ahyaayeeeyayay
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
@If I were a girl)
I would turn off my phone
@I wouldn't play games)
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that
I was sleeping alone
@Girl you know that's wrong)
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
to come home
@But you're not a boy
ahyaayeeeyayay
@So you can't understand
*ahyaayeeeyayay
@You are not a perfect woman
@And I am not a perfect man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
@Said I know how you feel)
When you lose the one you wanted
@wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
@granted
And everything you had
*got destroyed
@Said I'm sorry)
It's a little too late
for you to come back
@But I can't let you go
@'cause I'm too attached
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought
*wrong
But you're just a boy...
