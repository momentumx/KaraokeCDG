I heard you crying loud
all the way across town
Cause you been searching
for that someone
And it's me out on the prowl
As you just
sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
and dry your whining eyes
I'm just roaming for the moment
Sleazin' my back yard so don't get
So uptight you been thinking
about ditching me
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
Well, I heard it all before
so don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user
so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down
because I know you're right
So go do what you like
make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt
means nothing Was ever there
You can't go forcing something
if it's just not right
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
oooooo
No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around 
When I come around 
When I come around
