Incubus - Pardon me
Pardon me while I burst
A decade ago
I never thought I would be.
A twenty three
on the verge of spontaneous combustion
Woe is me
But I guess that it comes
with the territory.
An ominous landscape of
never ending calamity
I need you to hear
I need you to see.
That I have had all I can take
And exploding seems like an evident
possibility
To me
So Pardon me while I burst
into flames.
I've had enough of the world
and its people's mindless games
So Pardon me while I burn
and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me
I'll never be the same.
Not, two days ago
I was having a look in a book And I saw
a picture of a guy fried up above his knees
I said I can relate
Cause lately Ive been
thinkin of combustication
as a welcomed vacation from.
The burdens of
the planet earth
like gravity
hypocrisy
and the perils of being in three D
But thinking so much differently.
Pardon me while I burst
into flames.
I've had enough of the world
and it's people's mindless games
so Pardon me while I burn
and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me.
I'll never be the same.
Never be the same... yeah.
Pardon me while I burst
into flames
Pardon me
pardon me
pardon me.
So pardon me while I burst
into flames.
I've had enough of the world
and it's people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn
and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me
I'll never be the same
Pardon me, never be the same
Yeah
