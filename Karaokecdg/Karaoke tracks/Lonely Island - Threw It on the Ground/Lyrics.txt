Lonely Island - Threw It on the Ground
I was walkin' through the city streets
And a man walks up to me and hands
me the latest energy drink
"Run faster, jump higher"
Man I'm not gonna let you poison me
I threw it on the ground
You must think I'm a joke
I ain't gonna be part of your system
Man
Pump that garbage in another man's veins
I go to my favorite hot dog stand
And the dude says
You come here all the time
Here's one for free
I said, Man
What do I look like? A charity case?"
I took it and threw it on the ground!
I don't need your handouts!
I'm an adult!
Please!
You can't buy me hot dog, man!
At the farmer's market
with my so called girlfriend
She hands me her cell phone
says it's my dad
Man, this ain't my dad!
This is a cell phone!
I threw it on the ground!
What, you think I'm stupid?
I'm not a part of your system
My dad's not a phone!
DUH!
Some poser
hands me cake at a birthday party
Whatcha want me to do with this
Eat it?
Happy birthday to the ground!
I threw the rest of the cake, too!
Welcome to the real word, jackass!
So many things to throw on the ground
Like this, and this, and that
and even this
I'm an ADULT!
Two Hollywood phonies try to
give me their autograph
GROUND!
Nobody wants your autograph, phonies!
Then the two phonies got up
Turned out they had a taser
And they tased me in the butthole
Fell to the ground
The phonies didn't let up
Tasin' on my butthole
over and over
I was screamin' and squirmin'
My butthole was on fire
The moral of the story is
You can't trust the system
Man!
