Hawthorne Heights - Ohio Is For Lovers
Hey there,
I know it's
hard to feel
like I don't care at all.
Where you are and how you feel.
With these lights off as these wheels
keep rolling on and on.
(and on and on and on...)
Slow things down or speed them up.
Not enough or way too much.
(and on and on and on...)
How are you when I'm gone?
And I can't make it on my own.
(And I can't make it on my own.)
Because my heart is in Ohio.
So cut my wrists and black my eyes.
(Cut my wrists and black my eyes)
So I can fall asleep tonight, or die.
Because you kill me.
You know you do, you kill me well.
You like it too, and I can tell.
You never stop until my final breath is gone.
Spare me just three last words.
"I love you" is all she heard.
I'll wait for you
but I can't wait forever.
Spare me just three last words.
"I love you" is all she heard.
I'll wait for youuuu
but I can't wait forever.
And I can't make it on my own.
(And I can't make it on my own.)
Because my heart is in Ohio.
So cut my wrists and black my eyes.
(Cut my wrists and black my eyes)

Because you kill me.
You know you do, you kill me well.
You like it too, and I can tell.
You never stop until my final breath is gone.
You know you do, you kill me well.
You like it too, and I can tell.
You never stop until my final breath is gone.
So cut my wrists and black my eyes.

My final breath is
So I can fall asleep tonight
well
And I can't make it on my own
And I can't make it on my own
Because my heart is in Ohio.
