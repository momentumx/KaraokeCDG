Ludo - Love Me Dead
Love me cancerously
Like a salt sore soaked in the sea
High maintenance means
You're a gluttonous queen
Narcissistic and mean
Kill me romantically
Fill my soul with vomit
Then ask me for a piece of gum
Bitter and dumb
You're my sugarplum
You're awful, I love you!
She moves through moonbeams slowly
She knows just how to hold me
And when her edges soften
Her body is my coffin
I know she drains me slowly
She wears me down to bones in bed
Must be the sign on my head
That says, oh
Love me dead!
You're a faith-healer on T.V.
You're an office park without any trees
Corporate and cold
Gushing for gold
Leave me alone
You suck so passionately
You're a parasitic
psycho, filthy creature
Finger bangin' my heart
You call me up drunk
Does the fun ever start?
You're hideous and sexy!
She moves through moonbeams slowly
She knows just how to hold me
And when her edges soften
Her body is my coffin
I know she drains me slowly
She wears me down to bones in bed
Must be the sign on my head
That says, oh
Love me dead!
Love me dead!
Wow!
Ugghh!
Love me cancerously
brrrraaaght dat da da dada
brrrraaaght dat da da dada
How's your new boy?
Does he know about me?
You've got the mark of the beast
You're born of a jackal
You're beautiful!
She moves through moonbeams slowly
She knows just how to hold me
And when her edges soften
Her body is my coffin
I know she drains me slowly
She wears me down to bones in bed
Must be the sign on my head
That says, oh
Love me dead!
Love me dead!
Ooooohhh
Looooove
