Five finger death punch - The Bleeding
I remember when all the games began
Remember every little lie
And every last goodbye
Promises you broke, words you choked on
And I never walked away
its still a mystery to me
Well I'm soooo eeemptyyy
I'm better off without you
and you're better off without me
Well you're soooo uuuuncleeeean
I'm better off without you
and you're better off without me
The lying
The bleeding
The screaming
was tearing me apart
The hatred
Deceiving
The bleeding
It's over
Paint the mirrors black to forget you
I still picture your face
and the way you used to taste
Roses in a glass dead and wilted
To you this all was nothing,
Everything to you is nothing

Well you're so filthy
I'm better off without you
and you're better off without me
Well I'm so ugly
You're better off without me
and I'm better off alone
The lying
The bleeding
The screaming
was tearing me apart
The hatred
The beatings
Disaster
It's over

oowwwhhhhhhyyyyyy
Well As wicked as you are
you're beautiful to me

ooowwwwhhhhyyyyyyyyyy
You're the darkest burning star
your my perfect disease
The lying
The bleeding
The screaming, was tearing me apart
The hatred
The beatings
It's over
Disaster

The lying
The bleeding
The screaming, was tearing me apart
The hatred
The beatings
It's over
Disaster

It's over now
