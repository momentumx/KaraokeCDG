Staind - So Far Away
this is my life
its not what it was before
all these feelings i've shared
and these are my dreams
that i'd never lived before
somebody shake me cause i
i must be sleeping
now that we're here,
it's so far away
all the struggle we thought was in vain
all the mistakes,
one life can take
they all finally start to go away
now that we're here its so far away
and i feel like i can face the day
i can forgive and i'm not ashamed
to be the person that i am today
these are my words
that i've never said before
i think i'm doing okay
and this is the smile
that i've never shown before
somebody shake me 'cause i
i must be sleeping
now that we're here,
it's so far away
all the struggle we thought was in vain
all the mistakes,
one life can take
they all finally start to go away
now that we're here its so far away
and i feel like i can face the day
i can forgive and i'm not ashamed
to be the person that i am today
i'm so afraid of waking
please don't shake me
afraid of waking
please don't shake me
now that we're here,
it's so far away
all the struggle we thought was in vain
all the mistakes,
one life contained
they all finally start to go away
now that we're here its so far away
and i feel like i can face the day
i can forgive and i'm not ashamed
to be the person that i am today
