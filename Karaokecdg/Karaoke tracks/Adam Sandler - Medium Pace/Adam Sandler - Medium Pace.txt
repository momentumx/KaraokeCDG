Adam Sandler - Medium Pace
Put your arms around me babe,
Can't you see I need you so?
Hold me close against your skin,
I'm about to begin
Lovin' you.
Spit on your hand and
stroke my cock at a medium pace.
Play with my balls and
tell me how big they are.
Honey rub your beaver
up and down my face.
sit on the corner of the bed and
watch me whack off.
You see that shampoo bottle?
Now, stick it up my ass.
Push it in and out at a medium pace.
Talk about your old boyfriend's dick
and how big it was.
Now shave off my pubes and
punch me in the face.
Darling, make me push my
dick and balls back between my legs.
Call me an ugly woman and take
my picture to show all the people
you work with.
Now pull up my scrotum and take
that shampoo bottle out of my ass.
Pretend I'm the pizza delivery guy
and watch me whack off.
Strap on a dildo and
make me give you head.
Now tell me slow down and
do it at a medium pace.
I feel so humiliated
I'm about to blow my load.
You tell it's time to make love
but now I can't 'cuz I
spewed all over myself.
Then you look into my eyes
then you realize How much I enjoy
loving you. oh. I'm so sorry I
spunked all over my stomach.
Maybe next time I'll be better at
loving you.
